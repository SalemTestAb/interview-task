# Interview Task

This repository contains a coding [assignment](./assignment.md) used as part of Omegapoint's recruitment process.

## Getting Started

You may choose one of the programming languages outlined in the technical requirements in the [assignment](./assignment.md). A quick way to get started is by using GitHub Codespaces, a development environment configured with the basic SDK and runtimes required for most languages in a Visual Studio Code editor.

![How to start a codespace](./start_a_github_codespace.png "How to start a codespace")

For more information, refer to the [GitHub Codespaces Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart).

If you prefer to use a JetBrains IDE, follow the [setup instructions for using GitHub Codespaces in JetBrains IDE](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/using-github-codespaces-in-your-jetbrains-ide).

Using a Codespace is NOT a requirement for the assignment, just an optional developer environment.
